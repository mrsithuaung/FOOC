# FOOC
Future Object Oriented Compiler

# Abstract
This system would tell how the process was done in the background of a program
This system towards programmers who are learning deep programming language (syntax, semantic, pragamatic)
This system will be implemented design and implementation of an object-oriented Compiler  named FOOC (Future Object Oriented Compiler)
FOOC recognizes legal (and illegal) programs and it works like Scala, Jython and IronPython compilers

# Objective
To be familiar and understand Compiler Technology
To be easier and faster to learn the new programming language if you understand the Compiler well
To help a beginner to understand some implementation details of  an object-oriented programming language such as Lexer, Parser and Code Generator
To understand deeply language features you used
To know very well about compile time and runtime environment
